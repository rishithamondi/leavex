LEAVEX - An Online Leave Management System

Several problems were identified within the hostel community regarding leave management :
a.	Manual Paper-Based Process
b.	Delayed Approvals
c.	Lack of Transparency 
d.	Record Maintenance Issues 
e.	Limited Communication with Parents/Guardians
f.	No Centralized Digital System

Hostel administration plays a crucial role in ensuring student safety, discipline, and transparency. Traditionally, hostel leave applications are managed through manual registers or paper slips, which are often prone to delays, loss of records, and lack of accountability. This creates challenges for both students and wardens in processing leave requests efficiently.
To address these issues, our team developed the Hostel Leave Management System (HLMS), a web- based application that enables students to apply for leave online, and wardens/administrators approve, reject, and track leave requests seamlessly. Unlike manual systems, HLMS ensures real- time tracking, transparency, and secure record management, making hostel leave processing more reliable and user-friendly.The main aim of this project is to digitalize hostel leave workflows using web technologies, ensuring efficiency, accountability, and convenience for both students and hostel staff.
